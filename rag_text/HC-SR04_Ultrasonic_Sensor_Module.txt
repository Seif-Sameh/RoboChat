    - Item 1:
      code: #include <Arduino.h>
int trig=9;  
int echo=8; 
int duration;         
float distance;   
float meter;        
void setup() 
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  pinMode(trig, OUTPUT); 
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW); 
  delayMicroseconds(2);  
  pinMode(echo, INPUT); 
  delay(6000); 
  Serial.println("Distance:"); 
}  
void loop() 
{   
  digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);     
  delayMicroseconds(10);                
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);     
  duration = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);  
  if(duration>=38000){ 
      Serial.print("Out range");   
      }  
  else{ 
      distance = duration/58;    
      Serial.print(distance);     
      Serial.print("cm");  
      meter=distance/100; 
      Serial.print("\t"); 
      Serial.print(meter);  
      Serial.println("m"); 
      }  
  delay(1000);    
}
      explaination: This Arduino sketch triggers the HC-SR04 sensor, measures the echo pulse width, calculates distance in centimeters and meters, and prints the result to the Serial Monitor.
