description: The ISM330IS is a 6‑axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) system‑in‑package featuring a 3‑axis digital accelerometer and a 3‑axis digital gyroscope. It includes an ultra‑low‑power intelligent sensor processing unit (ISPU) for on‑edge AI and a sensor hub that can interface up to four external sensors. The device operates from 1.71 V to 3.6 V (analog) with an independent 1.62 V to 3.6 V IO supply, supports SPI and I²C serial interfaces, and is available in a compact LGA‑14L package (2.5 × 3.0 × 0.83 mm).

  - Industrial robots
  - Asset tracking
  - Anomaly detection and condition monitoring
  - Event detection in alarms and smart homes
  - Complex motion detection and gesture recognition for personal health
