getting_started:
  connection_guide: Connect VCC to 4.5–6.5 V supply, GND to ground, BAT to battery, ISENSE to sense resistor, PROG to a resistor to ground (200 Ω–1 kΩ for 200–700 mA), TIMER/SHDN to a capacitor for timer (1 µF typical). Use CHRG to monitor charge status.
  example_usage: USB charging: connect VCC to USB 5 V, use a 1 µF capacitor on TIMER/SHDN, set PROG to 1.3 kΩ for 700 mA, and monitor CHRG for LED indication.
