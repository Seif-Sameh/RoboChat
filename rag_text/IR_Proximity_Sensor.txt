    - Item 1:
      code: // Object counter
// Counts the number of objects and prints the results to the serial monitor.
// The circuit:
// * OUT attached to pin 2
// Created 2015
// by Harshit Borad <http://www.silicontechnolabs.in>

const int OUT = 2; // the number of the IR Proximity Sensor pin
const int ledPin = 13; // the number of the LED pin
int Number_of_Object = 0; // variable for reading the Number of Objects passing from sensor
int SensorState = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(OUT, INPUT); // initialize the IR Proximity Sensor pin as an input:
}

void loop() {
  SensorState = digitalRead(OUT); // read the state of the Sensor Signal
  if (SensorState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn LED on:
    Number_of_Object++;
    Serial.println(Number_of_Object); // print the results to the serial monitor:
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turn LED off:
  }
}
      explaination: This Arduino sketch reads the digital output of the IR proximity sensor. When an object is detected (sensor output HIGH), it turns on an onboard LED, increments a counter, and prints the count to the serial monitor.
