  connection_guide: Pin 1 connects to the input voltage source, pin 2 to ground, and pin 3 to the load. Place a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor between VIN and GND and a 0.1 µF capacitor between VOUT and GND for stability.
  example_usage: Typical fixed‑voltage regulator circuit: VIN → LM7805 → VOUT, with the recommended bypass capacitors.
