component_name: ULN2003 Stepper Driver Board
category: Motor Driver
manufacturer: 
sku: 
description: A stepper driver board based on the ULN2003 Darlington transistor array. It features four output channels capable of driving up to 500 mA per channel at up to 50 V. The board includes LED indicators for each control line, an ON/OFF jumper, and a keyed motor connector. It requires an external 5 V logic supply and a separate 5 V motor supply.
application_examples:
  - Driving a 28BYJ‑48 stepper motor with an Arduino
  - Controlling small DC motors or relays up to 500 mA
