component_name: HC-SR501 Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor
category: Sensor
manufacturer: Handson Technology
sku: 
description: A passive infrared motion sensor module featuring the LHI778 PIR sensor and BISS0001 IC. It offers adjustable sensitivity for a detection range of 3 to 7 meters, time delay adjustments from 0.3 to 5 minutes, and a trigger selection jumper for single or repeatable triggers. The module outputs a TTL signal (3.3V/0V) and operates on 5–20 VDC.
application_examples:
  - Dance floor motion detection with adjustable delay and trigger modes
  - Arduino-based motion-activated lighting or alerts

getting_started:
  connection_guide: Connect VCC to a 5–20 VDC supply, GND to ground, and the Output pin to a digital input on your microcontroller (e.g., Arduino pin 2). Use the Time Delay Adjustment, Sensitivity Adjust, and Trigger Selection Jumper to configure the sensor as needed.

    - Item 1:
      code: int led = 13;\nint sensor = 2;\nint state = LOW;\nint val = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(sensor, INPUT);\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n}\n\nvoid loop(){\n  val = digitalRead(sensor);\n  if (val == HIGH) {\n    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);\n    delay(100);\n    if (state == LOW) {\n      Serial.println("Motion detected!");\n      state = HIGH;\n    }\n  } else {\n    digitalWrite(led, LOW);\n    delay(200);\n    if (state == HIGH){\n      Serial.println("Motion stopped!");\n      state = LOW;\n    }\n  }\n}
      explaination: This Arduino sketch turns on an LED when motion is detected and prints status messages to the serial monitor. It accounts for the sensor’s 1‑minute initialization period by simply ignoring early false positives.
