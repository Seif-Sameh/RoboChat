  example_code:
    - Item 1:
      code: // IR Obstacle Collision Detection Module
// =======================================
int LED = 13; // Use the onboard Uno LED
int isObstaclePin = 7;  // This is our input pin
int isObstacle = HIGH;  // HIGH MEANS NO OBSTACLE

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(isObstaclePin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  isObstacle = digitalRead(isObstaclePin);
  if (isObstacle == LOW) {
    Serial.println("OBSTACLE!!, OBSTACLE!!");
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  } else {
    Serial.println("clear");
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  }
  delay(200);
}
      explaination: Reads the digital output from the IR obstacle sensor. When an obstacle is detected (output LOW), it prints a message and lights an LED.
